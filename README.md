# 🚀 Multi-Agent AI Product Architect  
### Autonomous AI Team that Transforms Ideas into Production-Ready Product Plans

> Build an AI-powered product team that collaborates like a real startup squad — turning a simple idea into a complete product blueprint with PRD, architecture, APIs, DB schema, and test cases.

---

## 🧠 Overview

**Multi-Agent AI Product Architect** is an autonomous AI system that simulates a real-world product team using role-based LLM agents.

Instead of a single chatbot, this system orchestrates multiple specialized agents:

- 🧠 Product Manager Agent  
- 🏗 Architecture Agent  
- 👨‍💻 Backend Agent  
- 🧪 Testing Agent  
- ⚠ Risk Analysis Agent  
- 📊 Evaluation Agent  

They collaborate through structured workflows, shared memory, and iterative refinement to produce production-ready outputs.

---

## 🎯 Why This Project Stands Out

Most AI projects = chatbot wrappers.

This project demonstrates:

✅ Agent orchestration  
✅ Role-based prompting  
✅ Multi-step reasoning  
✅ Structured JSON generation  
✅ Memory-based refinement  
✅ Output quality evaluation  
✅ System-level AI architecture  

This signals AI Engineering maturity, not just prompt usage.

## 🏗 System Architecture

### 🔁 Workflow Pipeline

1. User submits product idea  
2. Product Manager Agent creates PRD  
3. Architecture Agent designs system components  
4. Backend Agent generates:
   - API schema  
   - Database model  
   - Service layer outline  
5. Testing Agent generates:
   - Test cases  
   - Edge cases  
6. Risk Agent analyzes:
   - Scalability risks  
   - Security gaps  
   - Tech tradeoffs  
7. Evaluation Agent scores output quality  
8. Iterative refinement loop improves results

## 🧩 Agent Roles & Responsibilities

### 🧠 1. Product Manager Agent
- Converts idea → structured PRD
- Defines:
  - User personas
  - Functional requirements
  - Non-functional requirements
  - KPIs

---

### 🏗 2. Architecture Agent
- Designs:
  - System components
  - Data flow
  - Deployment model
- Suggests:
  - Tech stack
  - Scalability strategy

---

### 👨‍💻 3. Backend Agent
Generates structured JSON outputs:

```json
{
  "apis": [],
  "database_schema": [],
  "service_layer": []
}
```

Includes:
- REST endpoints
- Request/response models
- DB relationships
- Validation rules

---

### 🧪 4. Testing Agent
- Unit test scenarios  
- Integration test cases  
- Failure simulations  
- Edge case handling  

---

### ⚠ 5. Risk Analysis Agent
Identifies:
- Security risks  
- Scalability bottlenecks  
- Performance tradeoffs  
- Architectural weaknesses  

---

### 📊 6. Evaluation Agent
- Scores outputs (1–10)
- Validates completeness
- Checks consistency across agents
- Triggers refinement loop if needed

---

## 🎯 Why Recruiters Love This

This project signals:

- You understand LLM internals  
- You can design AI systems  
- You build production-like workflows  
- You think in architectural layers  
- You are NOT a “prompt-only” candidate  

In 10 seconds, they see:

RAG  
Agents  
Architecture  
Automation  
Evaluation loops  

That’s exactly what modern AI Engineering roles require.
